# Home Assistant Add-ons

This is a small set of add-ons for Home Assistant. These are ment to be as plain and simple as possible with no bells or whistles. There are no built-in VPN services or SMB mounting. If you need to mount an external drive, I suggest using this [80-mount-usb-to-media-by-label.rules](https://gist.github.com/eklex/c5fac345de5be9d9bc420510617c86b5) by @eklex. They do not have SSL support built in. I reccomend using the [NGINX Proxy Manager](https://github.com/hassio-addons/addon-nginx-proxy-manager) Add-on to handle all the external traffic as a proxy, and just use HTTP traffic on the internal network.

[![Open your Home Assistant instance and show the add add-on repository dialog with a specific repository URL pre-filled.](https://my.home-assistant.io/badges/supervisor_add_addon_repository.svg)](https://my.home-assistant.io/redirect/supervisor_add_addon_repository/?repository_url=https%3A%2F%2Fgithub.com%2Fhulkhaugen%2Fhassio-addons)

4. Paste https://github.com/hulkhaugen/hassio-addons and click `Add`.

Most importantly, these statistics include what has been watched, who watched it, when and where they watched it, and how it was watched. The only thing missing is "why they watched it", but who am I to question your 42 plays of Frozen. All statistics are presented in a nice and clean interface with many tables and graphs, which makes it easy to brag about your server to everyone else.
