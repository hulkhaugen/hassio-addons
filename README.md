# Home Assistant Add-ons

This is a small set of add-ons for Home Assistant. These are ment to be as plain and simple as possible with no bells or whistles. There are no built-in VPN services or SMB mounting. If you need to mount an external drive, i suggest using this [80-mount-usb-to-media-by-label.rules](https://gist.github.com/eklex/c5fac345de5be9d9bc420510617c86b5) by @eklex.
