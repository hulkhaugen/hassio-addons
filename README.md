# Home Assistant Add-ons

This is a small set of Add-ons for Home Assistant. These are ment to be as plain and simple as possible with no bells or whistles. There are no built-in VPN services or SMB mounting. They do not have SSL support built in. Some personal tips:

- Use the [NGINX Proxy Manager](https://github.com/hassio-addons/addon-nginx-proxy-manager) Add-on by @frenck to handle all the external traffic as a reverse proxy, and just use HTTP traffic on the internal network. NGINX Proxy Manager will handle SSL certificates and renewal for you.
- Mount external drives using [80-mount-usb-to-media-by-label.rules](https://gist.github.com/eklex/c5fac345de5be9d9bc420510617c86b5) by @eklex. This will autmatically mount your hard drives to `/media`. You can easily modify that file to mount in `/share` if you prefer, as I did.
- Use the internal backup functions of the Add-ons to store the backups in a folder you backup. For instance in [Sonarr](https://github.com/hulkhaugen/hassio-addons/tree/main/sonarr), navigate to `Settings` -> `General` and click on `Show Advanced`. Scroll down to `Backups` -> `Folder` and input something like `/media/addon_backups/sonarr/`. Now if you use something like the [Home Assistant Google Drive Backup](https://github.com/sabeechen/hassio-google-drive-backup) Add-on by @sabeechen, make sure you configure it to backup the `/media` folder, and ignore the `Sonarr` Add-on. This will save lots of space for your backups.

# Add-ons

## EmulatorJS

A mix of emulators is used between Libretro and EmulatorJS. The frontend application has been initially optimized around being used with a standard gamepad. The navigation revolves around the up/down/left/right keys to browse the menus and launch games. Mobile browsers will function, just keep in mind compatibility will be reduced especially for CD based games.

## Jellyfin

It is an alternative to the proprietary Emby and Plex, to provide media from a dedicated server to end-user devices via multiple apps. Jellyfin is descended from Emby's 3.5.2 release and ported to the .NET Core framework to enable full cross-platform support. There are no strings attached, no premium licenses or features, and no hidden agendas: just a team who want to build something better and work together to achieve it.

## NGINX Web Server

All statistics are presented in a nice and clean interface with many tables and graphs, which makes it easy to brag about your server to everyone else.
