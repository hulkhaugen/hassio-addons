[EmulatorJS](https://docs.linuxserver.io/images/docker-emulatorjs/) - In browser web based emulation portable to nearly any device for many retro consoles. A mix of emulators is used between Libretro and EmulatorJS.

The frontend application has been initially optimized around being used with a standard gamepad (more specifically for modern Xbox consoles that have chromium based Edge browsers). The navigation revolves around the up/down/left/right keys to browse the menus and launch games. Mobile browsers will function, just keep in mind compatibility will be reduced especially for CD based games.
